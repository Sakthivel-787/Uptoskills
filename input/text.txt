
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was originally developed 
by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. It is designed to be 
platform-independent, meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
making it highly versatile for developing cross-platform applications. Java emphasizes object-oriented principles,
such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, which allow developers to create modular, reusable and maintainable code. 
It has a strong memory management system, including automatic garbage collection, which reduces 
the likelihood of memory leaks.
